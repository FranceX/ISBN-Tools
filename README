Takes an unformatted ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 and formats it 
with dashes using the RangesMessage.xml file from 
www.isbn-international.org

You will have to download the xml file from 
http://www.isbn-international.org/agency?rmxml=1
and save it as ranges.xml in your working directory for this to work

This uses PHP's DOMDocument() to process the ranges XML file
